#  5.Setting Up Webpack
Modules have been available in JavaScript through third-party libraries. ECMAScript 6 adds native support for modules to JavaScript. When you compile a modular ECMAScript 6 application to ECMASCript 5, the compiler relies on a third party library to implement modules in ECMAScript 5. **Webpack** and **Browserify** are two popular options, and Babel supports both (and others). We use Webpack in this tutorial.

In this unit, you add Webpack to your development environment.

## Step 1: Set Up Webpack
1. On the command line, make sure you are in the `es6-tutorial` directory and install the babel-loader and webpack modules:     
 ```js
 npm install babel-loader webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
 ```
2. Open **package.json** in your code editor, and add a **webpack** script (right after the **babel** script). The scripts section should now look like this:
 ```js
 "scripts": {
    "babel": "babel --presets es2015 js/main.js -o build/main.bundle.js",
    "start": "http-server",
    "webpack": "webpack"
},
 ```
3. In the `es6-tutorial` directory, create a new file named `webpack.config.js` defined as follows:
 ```js
 var path = require('path');
 var webpack = require('webpack');

 module.exports = {
     entry: './js/main.js',
     output: {
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
         filename: 'main.bundle.js'
     },
    module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /\.js$/,
            include: [
              path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/js')
            ],
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
              loader: 'babel-loader',
              options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      },
     stats: {
         colors: true
     },
     devtool: 'source-map',
     mode: 'development'
 };
 ```
## Step 2: Build Using Webpack
1. On the command line, make sure you are in the es6-tutorial directory and type the following command:
 ```js
 npm run webpack
 ```
    Webpack uses Babel behind the scenes to compile your application. You can build an application using Webpack even if that application is not using ECMAScript 6 modules. In other words, the babel script in package.json is not needed anymore.
2. Open a browser, access http://localhost:8080, and click the Calculate button.
