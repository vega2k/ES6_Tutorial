#  3.Using Arrow Functions
The ECMAScript 6 arrow function syntax is a shorthand for the ECMAScript 5 function syntax. It supports both block and expression bodies. The value of this inside the function is not altered: it is the same as the value of this outside the function. No more var self = this to keep track of the current scope.

In this unit, you add a new function to calculate the mortgage amortization. You also modify the existing functions to use the new ECMAScript 6 arrow function syntax.

## Steps
1. Open `js/main.js`. Right after the `calculateMonthlyPayment` function, add a `calculateAmortization` function defined as follows:
 ```js
let calculateAmortization = (principal, years, rate) => {
    let {monthlyRate, monthlyPayment} = calculateMonthlyPayment(principal, years, rate);
    let balance = principal;
    let amortization = [];
    for (let y=0; y<years; y++) {
        let interestY = 0;  //Interest payment for year y
        let principalY = 0; //Principal payment for year y
        for (let m=0; m<12; m++) {
            let interestM = balance * monthlyRate;       //Interest payment for month m
            let principalM = monthlyPayment - interestM; //Principal payment for month m
            interestY = interestY + interestM;
            principalY = principalY + principalM;
            balance = balance - principalM;
        }
        amortization.push({principalY, interestY, balance});
    }
    return {monthlyPayment, monthlyRate, amortization};
};
 ```   
2. Modify the `calculateMonthlyPayment` function signature as follows:
 ```js
 let calculateMonthlyPayment = (principal, years, rate) => {
 ```
3. Modify the signature of the **calcBtn** click event handler as follows:
 ```js
 document.getElementById('calcBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {
```
4. In the calcBtn click event handler, invoke `calculateAmortization` function instead of `calculateMonthlyPayment`:
```js
let {monthlyPayment, monthlyRate, amortization} = calculateAmortization(principal, years, rate);
```
5. As the last line of the calcBtn click event handler, log amortization data to the console (youâ€™ll display the amortization table in the application in the next unit):
 ```js
 amortization.forEach(month => console.log(month));
 ```
 This is an example of an expression body.   
 The complete implementation of the button click handler looks like this:
 ```js
 document.getElementById('calcBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    let principal = document.getElementById("principal").value;
    let years = document.getElementById("years").value;
    let rate = document.getElementById("rate").value;
    let {monthlyPayment, monthlyRate, amortization} = calculateAmortization(principal, years, rate);
    document.getElementById("monthlyPayment").innerHTML = monthlyPayment.toFixed(2);
    document.getElementById("monthlyRate").innerHTML = (monthlyRate * 100).toFixed(2);
    amortization.forEach(month => console.log(month));
});
 ```   
6. On the command line, type the following command to rebuild the application:
 ```js
 npm run babel
 ```
7. Open a browser, access http://localhost:8080, and click the Calculate button. Open the developer console: you should see the amortization values in the console log.
