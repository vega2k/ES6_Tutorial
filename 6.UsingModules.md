#  6.Using Modules

In this unit, you create a module that exposes the business logic related to a mortgage, and you build the application using Webpack.

## Step 1: Create the Module
1. Create a new file named `mortgage.js` in the `js` directory. 

2. Copy the `calculateMonthlyPayment` and `calculateAmortization` functions from `main.js` into `mortgage.js`.
 
3. Add the `export` keyword in front of both functions to make them available as part of the module public API. `mortgage.js` should now look like this:
 ```js
 export let calculateMonthlyPayment = (principal, years, rate) => {
    let monthlyRate = 0;
    if (rate) {
        monthlyRate = rate / 100 / 12;
    }
    let monthlyPayment = principal * monthlyRate / (1 - (Math.pow(1/(1 + monthlyRate),
            years * 12)));
    return {principal, years, rate, monthlyPayment, monthlyRate};
};
    
export let calculateAmortization = (principal, years, rate) => {
    let {monthlyRate, monthlyPayment} = calculateMonthlyPayment(principal, years, rate);
    let balance = principal;
    let amortization = [];
    for (let y=0; y<years; y++) {
        let interestY = 0;  //Interest payment for year y
        let principalY = 0; //Principal payment for year y
        for (let m=0; m<12; m++) {
            let interestM = balance * monthlyRate;       //Interest payment for month m
            let principalM = monthlyPayment - interestM; //Principal payment for month m
            interestY = interestY + interestM;
            principalY = principalY + principalM;
            balance = balance - principalM;
        }
        amortization.push({principalY, interestY, balance});
    }
    return {monthlyPayment, monthlyRate, amortization};
};
 ```
## Step 2: Use the Module
1. In `main.js`, remove the `calculateMonthlyPayment` and `calculateAmortization` functions.

2. Add the following `import` statement as the first line in `main.js` to import the mortgage module:
 ```js
 import * as mortgage from './mortgage';
 ```
## Step 3: Build and Run
1. On the command line, type the following command to rebuild the application:
 ```js
 npm run webpack
 ```
2. Open a browser, access http://localhost:8080, and click the **Calculate** button.
